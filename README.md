# shopping_list_app

A new Flutter project. This project is a shopping list app that allows users to add items to a list and delete items from the list.

## Things I learned and revised in this project:
- How to use advanced widgets such as ListView, ListTile, and Dismissible.
- How to use `CircularProgressIndicator` to show a loading spinner.
- How to use `http` package to make API calls.
- How to send `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` requests.
- How to use `dart:convert` package to convert JSON data to Dart objects.
- How to use `try` and `catch` to catch errors.
